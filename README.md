# Yalci
Yet another local continuous integration tool

## Motivation

I want a tool that can

* watch a local git repository (even on a server)
* watch multiple branches of a single repository
* run multiple build definitions on the branch being changed (i.e. CI, code analysis, security scan)
* run user-defines build/deploy steps
* read configuration from an SQLize database

## Development status

Please see the [board](https://github.com/fuszenecker/Yalci/projects/1).
